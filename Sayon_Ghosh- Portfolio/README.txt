# A Portfolio Website of Sayon Ghosh

This is a personal portfolio built using only HTML and Tailwind CSS. It includes four main sections â€” Home, About, Projects, and Contact. I used utility-first classes provided by Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and clean layout. This project helped me learn the basics of UI/UX and structuring a portfolio from scratch.
